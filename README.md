# DT207-moment1-backend

For this project, I wanted the backend to work completely on its own, without relying on any frontend, even though the assignment allowed using static files with a view engine: EJS or Pug. I saw it as a chance to push myself and try building something that felt closer to real-world, production-level software (not that Iâ€™m saying this is quite there yet, but I figured it was time to start shaping up). Thatâ€™s why I went with an MVC-style backend using Node.js and Express.

I made a bunch of design choices that might seem a bit overkill for the size of the assignment, but I really wanted to experiment, learn new things, and bring in some of the stuff Iâ€™ve picked up over the years.

My solution, although very modular, is quite simple.
